      <h3> All about my trip to Greece</h2>
      <p> In this article I will be sharing a little bit about what I did during my trip to Greece. I was in Greece for 4 days, we visited a city named Rhodes. Greece is famous for its amazing beaches and clear-blue waters. In addition, the perfect beauty of Cycladic architecture, incredible sunset spots, and warm summer weather makes it one of Europe's most popular vacation destinations.</p>
       <p> <Strong><em>Rhodes</em> </Strong>is one of the most popular islands in Greece, things to do in Rhodes are many. The beaches of Rhodes are organized and many of them have water sports centers with fun games. Very popular in Rhodes is windsurfing and kite surfing. The best windsurfing spot is Prassonissi, on the southern side of the island, but Theologos, Ixia and other beaches close to <br> Rhodes Town are also nice for this sports. Many diving centers have also opened over the last years in Rhodes island, offering courses and organizing diving trips to close islands and old wrecks. Another activity in Rhodes is hiking in the inland. The countryside of the island is crossed by old footsteps leading to green valleys, mountainous villages, Medieval castles, and secluded beaches to swim.

<h2 id="heading2"> Lindos </h2>
  <p> <strong><em>Lindos</em></strong> is situated on the Greek island of Rhodes, Lindos is a town full of ancient history and legends, a lot of which is still evident today. Famous for being the second most visited archaeological site in Greece, coming second only to Delphi, there are many artefacts, buildings and monuments packed into this small town. Lindos is also one of the cities we had visited during our stay in <em> Rhodes,Greece</em>, it was approximetly an hour away from where we was staying. It was 34 degree that day and therefore not ideal to be going out exploring. Nonetheless I enjoyed my visit to Lindos, the scenery, atmosphere, the people etc it was all worth the travel.</p>
