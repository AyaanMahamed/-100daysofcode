        <h1>Autobiography</h1>
        <h2> All about me </h2>
        <p> My name is Ayaan, I am 30 years young. I was born in Somalia in 1992 but raised in Sweden from 1995- 2007. I moved to the UK in 2007 at the age 15, my parents could not have picked a worser time for me to move being that I was in the midst of preparing for my exams. When I moved to the UK, I was not able to find a school that would take me on in the middle of year 10 let alone waste GCSE papers on me. I had to start college at the age of 15 and learn the English language, fast forward few years I am now a qualified general nurse with 6 years experience. I use to work in the hospital but I am currently working in the Department for work and pension as a functional analyst. </p>

        <h4> Why I want to change my career</h4>
        <p> As much as nursing seems like a rewarding job, unfortunately I have lost my passion and drive for it due to many reasons. I would say that I am a perfectionist and due to the high demand of NHS, it does not allow me to care for my patients to my best ability and to give them the individual care that they require. I would also consider myself to be a very creative person from early on, I like problem solving and I have always had eye for details, and I truly believe that tech will allow me to further explore my passion. So far, I have been absolutely loving it and I only hope it continues to be that way.  </p>
